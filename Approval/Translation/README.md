# Translation Workflows #

These workflows provide an example of a one-way translation from English to Spanish.
A Contributor user would create English-language content that is approved in English,
then passed onto an English-Spanish translator user. The translation is completed and
then approved by a Translation Approver user. Only once the Spanish translation is approved
are both the English-language Page and the Spanish-language Page published.

See diagrams in the [Diagram folder](./Diagram/) that illustrate how the three XML files
interact.
