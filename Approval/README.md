*   **one-step-approval.cswf.xml**  
    Send to an approver who can request changes, accept and publish, or edit themselves.
*   **approval-with-owner-draft.cswf.xml**  
    Same as above but owner has opportunity to continue editing before sending to approver.
*   **approval-with-publish-hold.cswf.xml**  
    Same as above but approver can save asset into a 'Publish Hold' step so that changes
    are present and visible in Cascade Server but not yet published.
*   **collaborative-approval.xml**  
    Very different from the above three workflows. Allows workflow owner to select three other
    collaborators so that the asset can be passed around and commented upon before being sent
    onto the final approver.
